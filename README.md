# gopro_ros

This repository contains code for parsing GoPro telemetry metadata to obtain GoPro images with synchronized IMU measurements. The GoPro visual-inertial data can then be saved in [rosbag](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag) or [Euroc](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) format. Thus, effectively paving the way for visual-inertial odometry/SLAM for GoPro cameras.

The code will be made available later after ICRA submission.
